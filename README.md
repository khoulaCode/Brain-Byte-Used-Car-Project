# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

Welcome to the **Used Car Price Prediction Challenge**! 🎉
This project is designed to help you **level up your end-to-end data science skills** — from scraping real-world data, to building predictive models, to designing a user-friendly interface.

Each team will complete the **entire workflow** and compete to see who can engineer the best features and achieve the **highest R² score**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

* **Goal:** Predict used car prices from [dubizzle.com.om](https://www.dubizzle.com.om/motors/) data.
* **Teams:** 4 teams of 5 members each.
* **Focus:** End-to-end ML pipeline + UI development.
* **Key Skill Areas:**

  * Data scraping & cleaning
  * Feature engineering
  * Regression modeling & evaluation
  * R² score optimization
  * Streamlit app development
  * Team collaboration & presentation

---

## 🛠 Workflow

1. **Data Scraping & Cleaning**

   * Scrape used car listings from dubizzle.com.om.
   * Handle challenges like missing data, text cleaning, and formatting.
   * Deliver a clean dataset ready for modeling.

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Design and test new features to improve predictions.
   * This is the *main differentiator* between teams.

3. **Model Development**

   * Train at least 3 regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Polynomial Regression).
   * Evaluate on a test split using **R² score**.
   * Select your best-performing model.

4. **User Interface**

   * Build a **Streamlit app** where users can input car details and get price predictions.
   * Focus on clarity, simplicity, and usability.

5. **Presentation & Comparison**

   * Share your process, challenges, and results.
   * Compete based on **model accuracy, feature creativity, and app usability**.
